## ‚ùî Description
This game was developed in vanilla TypeScript using no external libraries or technologies (outside of React for page rendering). This was created as my capstone project for Epicodus. I was inspired to create a project that combined my passion for game design with my passion for music. For more information, see the Development Log section below.

**Your objective**: Upload an audio file, then run through a level generated directly from the audio data while dodging obstacles in your way!

## üìÉ Development Log
The development of this game happened in 120 hours of Epicodus class time. Below is a list of resources in other repositories that display my progress taking the game from a concept into an actual finished project.
- Dec 1, 2023: [Capstone Idea Outline](https://github.com/mejia-dev/epicodus-capstone-planning) - The idea board and subsequent notes in this repository laid the foundational ideas for what I wanted to do for my Capstone.
- Mar 22, 2024: [Timetracker & Development Log](https://github.com/mejia-dev/epicodus-capstone-mvp/blob/main/Timetracker.md) - This is the master devlog for the game, and also how I kept track of the time spent on the project. This file was updated until the very last day of development.
- Mar 25, 2024: [Formal Capstone Proposal](https://github.com/mejia-dev/epicodus-capstone-mvp/blob/main/capstone-proposal.md) - This is my proposal of my Capstone project that I submitted to Epicodus.
- Mar 30, 2024 - Apr 29, 2024: [Development Demos](https://github.com/mejia-dev/epicodus-capstone-mvp/tree/main/demos) - This is a link to some folders containing demos of early versions of the MVP of the game. I kept these around as separate files so that they were easy to quickly inspect.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Bugs
If you see an issue, please report it on the [Issues](https://github.com/mejia-dev/rhythmrunner/issues) page.
- Line 31 of `GameRendering.tsx` uses an `any` variable declaration.
- Player falls back to ground very quickly after resuming from pause.
- Player invincibility glow can stay active after the track is restarted.
- Audio tracks with consistent/ambient low frequencies can cause visualizer and rendering to become glitchy.

## Additional Vite Information

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
